# Project Title

BookBabble

## Overview

A platform where users can write reviews for books theyâ€™ve read, rate them, and recommend them to others. The server would handle storing user reviews and serving book data.

### Problem

Often times when we are looking for a good book to read, we end up on the websites that are usually selling those books, so only the critic reviews are highlighted and the general reader reviews are usually not included, so with my application all the general readers will be able to see genuine reviews on a book that other users have already read before they make a purchase.

### User Profile

My application is mainly focused on general readers who share the same passion for a good read and want to see the real reviews on a book instead of any sponsored critic reviews.

### Features

I will have database containing list of books which will store the book titles, author names, description of the book and user reviews. Users can search for a book by Title, Author Name, Genre or pick a book title from the Home Page which is going to include some of the top rated books with most high rated reviews.

## Implementation

Back-end server to store data like list of Books, User Reviews and Descriptions of the books.

### Tech Stack

React application, Express server, external node modules as needed

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

I will have a default user login info which would be needed to add a new review on a book and this will be implemented using a default token that will be passed to authenticate the user

## Roadmap

1. Create a Mock-up of the Application and the necessary Styleguide
2. Build back-end with all the necessary routes including the books database.
3. Get the functionality of the application working and connecting it to the back-end.
4. Styling the Application for the best User Experience and an easy to use User Interface.

## Nice-to-haves

Create Account functionality, building a community like environment for the like-minded book readers and ability to interact with other users.
